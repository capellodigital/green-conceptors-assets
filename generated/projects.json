    "content": "### Flower Auction Plantion, The Netherlands\nPlantion is a bustling marketplace for florists, landscapers, and retailers.\nEvery day in the early morning, florists purchase fresh, wonderfully fragrant products for their shops at the clock auction. Through personal contact, the mediation department connects buyers and growers.\nPlantion has been in existence since 2008, with the history of the underlying auctions dating back more than a hundred years. Many small, local auctions have merged over the years into larger regional marketplaces. In 2008, Bloemenveiling Oost Nederland and Veiling Vleuten merged to form Plantion, resulting in a new marketplace in Ede designed by Breddels Architects in 2010.\nWhen it became clear at the end of 2007 that our conceived space-saving stacked auction concept for Plantion in Ede was somewhat too daring, we reverted to optimizing and automating the traditional \"spread-out-type\" auction complex. In this 65,000 m² \"flat pancake,\" we sought an architectural counterpoint.\nWe designed a 300-meter-long ascending facade along the railway, spiraling into a curl reaching towards the sky at the A30 ramp. This curl symbolizes an intertwined 45-meter-high crown of a flower, alerting passersby to the core business of this modern marketplace. Beneath the crown are the crown offices located above the processing center and buyer boxes.\nIn 2023, a new multifunctional processing center of 6,250 m² was realized. With this, Plantion offers more facilities to customers, and logistical flows are also more efficiently organized. The expansion of the processing center seamlessly integrates with the existing building; the roofline of the new construction merges seamlessly with the existing structure. The existing prefabricated concrete plinths with leaf motif have been reused in the new construction.\nThe new processing center includes a loading dock with seven additional delivery docks and a large dispatch area. The sides of the docks are made of prefabricated concrete elements. The 6,250 m² expansion includes a delivery hall of 3,850 m², a shared cold storage of 150 m², and rentable box spaces with transport corridors of 2,250 m². With the delivery through this expansion, the distribution of goods in the existing large auction hall can be largely automated.\nThe new marketplace consists of five contiguous building parts:\nBuilding A contains the auction company with the dispatch, auction hall, a large auction room, a company restaurant, and offices.\nBuilding B contains the processing center, rentable box spaces, and crown offices for trading companies affiliated with the auction.\nBuilding C contains the loading hall where customers (florists and landscapers) can take their purchased items directly.\nBuilding D contains the Wholesale Center (plants, flowers, hydroponics, and hardware) and the Plantion Green Center.\nBuilding E contains a large delivery hall with a loading dock and rentable box spaces.\nThe auction room has a capacity of 400 buyers and is set up as an auditorium so that, along with the auction hall and adjoining restaurant space, it can also be used as a conference center outside of auction times.\nSustainability Plantion is built according to sustainable principles, considering minimal gas consumption and minimal CO2 emissions. Energy is obtained from a heat-cold storage system. Through pipe-carrying concrete floors, warm water is used for heating beneath the offices and the auction room. Walls and floors are fully insulated. Thanks to special plastic roofing, watering of the own flowers and plants (including the green center) with rainwater is possible. The water buffer serves as firewater supply, including for the sprinkler system in the auction complex.\nIn 2017, 18,500 solar panels (more than three soccer fields) were installed on the roof of Plantion, generating a capacity of 950 kWp. This is sufficient to have 25% of Plantion's total annual electricity consumption generated by solar energy. Besides providing a small economic advantage, this leads to a significant improvement in terms of CO2 emissions. The amount of CO2 emissions will decrease by 325 tons per year, with a total CO2 reduction of over 17,000 tons over twenty years.\nThis is one of the larger roof-mounted solar panel projects in the Netherlands to date. In addition to use for the own building, a limited amount of electricity will also be fed back into the grid.\nA quote from Plantion: \"We are very proud of our building in Ede. It is beautiful, light, and clean, and also easily accessible (A12-A30). But what makes it especially remarkable is its sustainable nature. Plantion doesn't use regular energy, but naturally heated and cooled water. Our building is also maximally insulated and equipped with solar panels. This saves costs and is good for the environment!\"\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/0780_01.jpg)\n",

    "content": "## GreenConceptors creates green Campus for Trespa®\nGreenConceptors is proud to have worked with Trespa®, the renowned producer of Trespa® products, to create a green campus for their factory in Weert, The Netherlands. At GreenConceptors, we believe that businesses have a responsibility to protect and enhance the environment, and we were delighted to work with Trespa® to bring this vision to life.\nThe Entrance we changed in a parc surrounded enviornment where the trees cover the building with colourfull leaves.\nWe partnered with Ebben nurseries, the largest tree nursery in the Netherlands, to create an optimal plan that would embrace nature and green the factory. Our plan was designed to create a green oasis in the heart of the industrial area, where Trespa's factory is located. We wanted to create an environment that would not only look beautiful, but would also have a positive impact on the local ecosystem.\nTo achieve this, we planted over 700 large trees as part of our plan. These trees have had an immediate impact on the green ambiance of the factory, creating a welcoming and calming environment for both employees and visitors. The trees have also helped to reduce the carbon footprint of the factory by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air.\n\n\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/before-and-after-trespa-campus.jpg)\n\n\nBefore and After\n**Water retention**\nOur plan also focused on increasing water retention on the site, which is crucial in an area that experiences heavy rainfall. By using permeable materials for walkways and creating green areas, we were able to capture and retain rainwater, which can then be used to irrigate the plants on site. This not only helps to reduce the amount of water that needs to be taken from local sources, but it also helps to prevent flooding in the area.\n\n\n\n**Biodiversity**\nIn addition to water retention, our plan was also designed to increase biodiversity on the site. By creating a habitat for birds, bees, and other wildlife, we were able to promote the growth of local ecosystems. This is particularly important in areas that have been heavily developed, as they often lack the necessary habitats for wildlife to thrive.\n\n\n\n**Green Campus**\n\n![Page Image 3](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/3_3.jpg)\n\n\nCreating a botanical garden between the two headoffices gave the possibility for the employees to be really surrounded by green. The previous almost empty space was turned into a green oases of large scale plants and trees. \n\nOverall, our plan was focused on creating a green world within the confines of the Trespa® factory in Weert. We wanted to create an environment that was not only beautiful and welcoming, but also had a positive impact on the local ecosystem. By working closely with Trespa® and Ebben nurseries, we were able to achieve this vision and create a green campus that we can all be proud of.\n\nAt GreenConceptors, we believe that businesses have a responsibility to protect and enhance the environment. We are passionate about creating sustainable solutions that benefit both the environment and the people who use them.

By using these large scale objects it becomes possible to create a beautiful green atmosphere.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "## Waterdrinker Plant Center, The Netherlands\nThe Waterdrinker Plant Center symbolizes confidence in the future. This new building, with 27,000 m² of logistics space and 4,500 m² of offices, provides ample room for the growth and flourishing of the floriculture industry.\nWaterdrinker is the European market leader in the export of indoor and outdoor plants and, in collaboration with the FloraHolland flower auction, is developing a new trading area on the eastern side of the Aalsmeer auction. The Plant Center is the first building to rise here. Previously, Waterdrinker's export activities were spread across four different locations on the auction site, but the new construction brings them all together under one roof. This not only means more efficient logistics but also better climatic conditions and working environments.\nThe building is simple and efficient in design yet surprising in its details. A rectangular volume is clad with striking blue façade panels. On the ground floor, the logistics functions are housed, while the offices occupy the upper floor. Sawtooth roofs generously provide daylight for both people and plants. A large office garden offers plenty of space for pleasant and bright workspaces. Informal meeting places can be found in the corridors. Additionally, there are separate meeting and boardrooms and a flexible presentation space, easily adaptable for various setups. The cafeteria directly adjoins a secluded rooftop garden.\nWarm and mostly natural materials have been chosen for the interior finishes. For example, the staircase and entrance are finished with wood. Floral motifs on the carpet allude to what this place is really all about.\n\n",

    "content": "## West Coast Gardens Canada\nWest Coast Gardens is a Canadian-based entrepreneur that has been making waves in the horticulture industry for many years. In 2022, they will be expanding their operations with a brand new green house facility that is set to become a hub for sustainability and greenery in the country.\nThe new facility is located in the heart of Canada's lush green countryside, providing a perfect setting for the cultivation of plants and flowers. The routing of the new building has been carefully planned to optimize the distribution of space and ensure that each area of the facility is used to its full potential.\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/1_28--photo_2.jpg)\n\n\n### \nOne of the key features of the new facility is its commitment to sustainability. West Coast Gardens has always been passionate about reducing its environmental impact and the new green house is no exception. The facility has been designed to incorporate the latest in sustainable technology, including energy-efficient lighting, rainwater harvesting systems and natural ventilation.\nBut sustainability is not just about using technology. It's also about creating a business model that is economically viable and socially responsible. West Coast Gardens has always been committed to working with local communities and suppliers, and this ethos will be at the heart of the new facility. By building strong relationships with local businesses and organizations, West Coast Gardens hopes to create a sustainable business model that benefits everyone involved.\n![Page Image 1](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/west-coast-canada-1.jpeg)\n\n\n### \nThe new green house will also be a showcase for the latest in horticultural techniques and innovations. The facility will feature state-of-the-art hydroponic systems, allowing for the cultivation of plants in nutrient-rich water rather than soil. This technology has many advantages over traditional soil-based cultivation, including higher yields, faster growth rates and more consistent crop quality.\nIn addition to hydroponics, the new green house will also feature advanced lighting systems that allow for precise control of light intensity and spectrum. This technology can be used to manipulate the growth and development of plants, creating new varieties with unique colors, shapes and sizes.\nOf course, the new facility will also be a haven for plant enthusiasts and gardeners. Visitors to West Coast Gardens will be able to explore the green house and see firsthand the incredible range of plants and flowers that can be grown using the latest horticultural techniques. They will also be able to attend workshops and classes, learning from experts about how to cultivate their own gardens and create stunning floral displays.\n![Page Image 2](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/west-coast-canada-11.jpeg)\n\n\n### \nBut perhaps the most exciting aspect of the new facility is its potential to inspire others to embrace sustainability and environmental stewardship. By showcasing the latest in sustainable technology and business practices, West Coast Gardens hopes to encourage other businesses and individuals to take action to reduce their environmental impact.\nThe horticulture industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation, but it doesn't have to be this way. With the right technology and mindset, it is possible to create a sustainable, profitable and socially responsible business model.\nWest Coast Gardens is leading the way in this regard, and the new green house facility is a testament to their commitment to sustainability and innovation. As we move towards a more sustainable future, it's businesses like West Coast Gardens that will be at the forefront of this transformation.\n![Page Image 3](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/west-coast-canada-13.jpeg)\n\n\n### \nIn conclusion, West Coast Gardens' new green house facility in Canada is a fantastic addition to the horticultural industry. The facility is designed with sustainability in mind and will showcase the latest in horticultural techniques and innovations. The facility's commitment to working with local communities and suppliers is also admirable, and sets an example for other businesses to follow. Overall, the new green house facility is a testament to West Coast Gardens' commitment to sustainability and innovation, and is sure to inspire others to embrace a more environmentally-friendly business model.\n\n",

    "content": "## Botanical greenhouse design, Kuwait\nGreenConceptors, a renowned landscape design company, has designed a stunning botanical garden in the heart of the desert in Kuwait. The challenge was to create a year-round botanical greenhouse that would entertain and educate visitors about nature, while showcasing different types of gardens from around the world. The result is a breathtaking oasis in the middle of the arid desert, featuring Japanese-style gardens, Chinese gardens, flower gardens, butterfly gardens, European gardens, and even a hanging garden.\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/3_2--photo.jpg)\n\n\n### \nThe botanical garden is designed to be an immersive experience, where visitors can wander through the various gardens and appreciate the beauty of nature. Each garden is meticulously designed to reflect the cultural and environmental characteristics of the region it represents. For example, the Japanese garden features a serene koi pond, stone lanterns, and carefully pruned trees, while the Chinese garden is filled with bamboo groves, pagodas, and water features.\nOne of the most striking features of the botanical garden is the flower garden. The vibrant colors and fragrant scents of the flowers create a sensory explosion that is sure to delight visitors of all ages. The butterfly garden is another highlight, where visitors can watch as these beautiful creatures flit from flower to flower.\n![Page Image 1](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/3_10--photo_2.jpg)\n\n\n### \nThe European garden is designed to showcase the lush greenery of the continent, with carefully curated displays of flowers, shrubs, and trees. Visitors can wander through the garden and appreciate the beauty of the European countryside, without ever leaving Kuwait.\nThe hanging garden is a unique feature that sets this botanical garden apart from others. Plants are suspended from the ceiling, creating a stunning vertical garden that is both visually striking and environmentally friendly. The hanging garden also helps to regulate the temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse, making it a comfortable environment for both visitors and plants.\n![Page Image 2](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/6_34--photo.jpg)\n\n\n### \nIn addition to its aesthetic appeal, the botanical garden is also designed to be educational. Visitors can learn about the different types of plants and gardening techniques used in each garden, as well as the cultural and environmental significance of each region. The botanical garden is also committed to sustainability, with a focus on using environmentally friendly practices and materials.\n![Page Image 3](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/test-3_35_29--photo.jpg)\n\n\n### \nThe GreenConceptors team faced numerous challenges in designing and building the botanical garden, including the extreme heat and arid climate of the desert. However, their innovative design solutions and commitment to sustainability ensured that the botanical garden would thrive in this challenging environment.\n![Page Image 4](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/test-4_35--photo.jpg)\n\n\n### \n\n\n",

    "content": "## A Futuristic Vision Unfolding in Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia's ambition for technological innovation and economic diversification is boldly epitomized by NEOM, a groundbreaking project that promises to redefine the future of urban living and sustainable development. At the heart of this endeavor lies the NEOM Media Park, where we've had the privilege to contribute to its design, marking a pivotal step in shaping the landscape of tomorrow.\nNEOM, spanning across 26,500 square kilometers in the northwestern region of Saudi Arabia, is envisioned as a futuristic metropolis blending cutting-edge technology with sustainable living. With a focus on sectors like energy, biotechnology, tourism, and media, NEOM aims to become a global hub for innovation and investment, driving economic growth and fostering a dynamic ecosystem for businesses and residents alike.\nThe NEOM Media Park represents a crucial component of this grand vision, poised to revolutionize the media landscape in the region and beyond. As part of the design team, we were entrusted with crafting spaces that not only embody innovation and creativity but also reflect the cultural heritage and values of Saudi Arabia. From state-of-the-art studios to collaborative workspaces, every aspect of the Media Park is meticulously planned to inspire collaboration, innovation, and excellence in media production and content creation.\nOne of the key principles guiding the design process is sustainability. NEOM is committed to achieving carbon neutrality and preserving the natural environment, and the Media Park is no exception. Green spaces, renewable energy sources, and eco-friendly infrastructure are seamlessly integrated into the design, ensuring minimal environmental impact and maximum efficiency.\nMoreover, the Media Park is designed to foster inclusivity and diversity, welcoming talents from around the world to contribute to its vibrant media ecosystem. It will serve as a platform for creativity and expression, facilitating the exchange of ideas and narratives that transcend borders and cultures.\nIn addition to its economic and cultural significance, the NEOM Media Park holds immense potential to drive social transformation and empowerment. By providing opportunities for skill development, education, and entrepreneurship, it aims to empower Saudi youth and women, equipping them with the tools and resources to thrive in the digital age.\nAs NEOM continues to take shape, it represents a beacon of hope and possibility for Saudi Arabia and the world. It embodies the spirit of innovation, resilience, and collaboration, offering a glimpse into a future where technology serves humanity and sustainability is the cornerstone of progress.\nIn conclusion, our involvement in the design of the NEOM Media Park is not just a testament to our expertise but also a testament to our shared commitment to shaping a better future. Together with our partners and collaborators, we look forward to witnessing the transformative impact of NEOM and the Media Park on the global stage.\n\n",

With the help of experienced designers and architects, the Borghuis family is all set to create a unique circular building that will set a new standard in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency.\nThe project is aimed at optimizing the existing garden center, by adding a new cold house and turning the old cold house into a warm area by changing the roof and adding energy-saving installations. The building will also feature a new in-store design, routing optimization, and shelving plan to enhance customer experience and convenience.\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/6_1--photo.jpg)\n\n\n### \nThe team of designers and architects worked closely with the owners to create a design that maximizes the use of sustainable materials, energy-efficient installations, and circular building principles. The project is a perfect example of how businesses can contribute to a more sustainable future by incorporating circular building practices in their operations.\nCircular building is a relatively new concept that aims to reduce waste and increase resource efficiency by designing buildings that are adaptable, reusable, and designed to minimize environmental impact. It involves designing buildings that are energy-efficient, use sustainable materials, and can be easily dismantled and reused at the end of their lifespan. The concept is gaining popularity globally as more and more businesses realize the importance of sustainability in their operations.\nThe Intratuin Zwolle project is a perfect example of how circular building principles can be applied to a commercial project. The building will be constructed using sustainable materials and energy-efficient installations, ensuring that it minimizes its carbon footprint. The addition of a new cold house and the conversion of the old one into a warm area will also help to optimize the use of space and reduce energy consumption.\n![Page Image 1](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/100_76--photo-2_1.jpg)\n\n\n### \nIn addition to the sustainable building practices, the project also aims to enhance the customer experience by creating an optimal routing plan and shelving plan. The in-store design will be carefully planned to ensure that customers can easily navigate the store and find what they are looking for. This will not only enhance the customer experience but also increase sales and profitability.\n![Page Image 2](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/1_56--photo_1.jpg)\n\n\n### \nThe project is also a testament to the power of collaboration between businesses and designers. The Borghuis family worked closely with the designers and architects to ensure that the project was aligned with their vision and objectives. This collaboration ensured that the project was completed on time and within budget, while also meeting the highest standards of sustainability and energy efficiency.\nThe Intratuin Zwolle garden center is set to become a new landmark in the Netherlands, showcasing the potential of circular building practices in commercial projects. The project will set a new standard in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency, inspiring other businesses to follow suit and embrace circular building principles.\nThe project is also a reminder that businesses can play a vital role in promoting sustainability and reducing their impact on the environment. By incorporating sustainable practices in their operations, businesses can not only reduce their carbon footprint but also increase their profitability and appeal to environmentally conscious customers.\n![Page Image 3](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/9_16--photo.jpg)\n\n\n### \nIn conclusion, the Intratuin Zwolle project is an excellent example of how circular building practices can be applied to commercial projects. The project showcases the potential of sustainable design and energy efficiency to create buildings that are not only environmentally friendly but also economically viable. The project is set to become a new landmark in the Netherlands, inspiring other businesses to follow suit and embrace circular building principles in their operations.\nWe are looking forward to the opening this season!\n\n",

    "content": "## Botanical concept design Tiblisi City, Georgia\nThe city of Tbilisi, located in Georgia, has a rich history and cultural heritage. However, like many cities, there are areas that have been forgotten and neglected over time. It is always exciting when an opportunity arises to renew these areas and bring new life to them. Recently, we had the privilege of working on a concept design for our client to renew an area of the city that had been forgotten.\nThe area we were tasked with renewing was already a popular spot for people to recreate and play. However, it lacked a certain charm and identity that would make it truly special. We set out to design a concept that would not only enhance the area but also create a unique experience for visitors.\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/12_3.jpg)\n\n\nOne of the key features of our design was the addition of a Japanese botanical garden on higher ground. This garden not only provided a beautiful and serene space for visitors to escape the hustle and bustle of the city but also offered breathtaking views of the valley below. The design of the garden incorporated traditional Japanese landscaping techniques such as rock gardens, water features, and carefully curated plant selections.\nThe botanical garden was designed to be a multi-seasonal attraction. In the spring, visitors could enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms, while in the summer, they could escape the heat by walking among the shaded trees and taking in the views from the top of the hill. During the fall, the changing colors of the leaves would provide a stunning backdrop, while in the winter, the garden would be transformed into a winter wonderland with carefully placed lighting and snow-covered trees.\nIn addition to the botanical garden, we also restored an old and forgotten stage in the area to create an outdoor theatre. The theatre was designed to be an intimate space that would allow visitors to enjoy music, plays, and other performances in a unique and memorable setting. The stage was carefully restored to its former glory, and new seating areas were added to provide a comfortable experience for visitors.\n![Page Image 1](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/2_60--foto_1.jpg)\n\n\nThe outdoor theatre was designed with versatility in mind. The stage area could be transformed into a dance floor for events such as weddings or other celebrations, while the seating areas could be rearranged to accommodate larger or smaller crowds. The theatre was also designed to be fully accessible, with ramps and designated seating areas for those with mobility needs.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this project was the opportunity to work with local artists and artisans to incorporate their work into the design. We commissioned several large-scale art installations that would be displayed throughout the area, providing a unique and immersive experience for visitors. The art installations were designed to be interactive and thought-provoking, encouraging visitors to engage with the space in new and creative ways.\nAnother important aspect of our design was sustainability. We incorporated several eco-friendly features such as rainwater harvesting, solar lighting, and composting facilities. We also worked with local businesses to source materials and labor, supporting the local economy and reducing our carbon footprint.\n![Page Image 2](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/15_4.jpg)\n\n\nOverall, our concept design for the renewal of the forgotten area in Tbilisi was a great success. We were able to bring new life to the area, creating a unique and memorable experience for visitors while also promoting sustainability and supporting the local community. The addition of the Japanese botanical garden, outdoor theatre, and art installations added a new dimension to the area, making it a destination for locals and tourists alike.\n![Page Image 3](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/2_53--foto.jpg)\n\n\nProjects like this are a reminder of the importance of revitalizing neglected areas in our cities. By breathing new life into forgotten spaces, we can create vibrant and thriving communities that are sustainable, diverse, and inclusive. We hope that our concept design for the renewal of the forgotten area in Tbilisi will serve as a model for future projects and inspire others to invest in their communities.\n\n",

    "content": "## Vertical Greenwall Restaurant Humbodlt\nThe Therme Group is a world leader in providing wellness and spa experiences. The company operates over 20 thermal bath complexes across Europe and Asia, offering a range of thermal pools, saunas, massages, and other treatments. In recent years, the company has been focusing on sustainability and eco-friendliness, with a particular emphasis on indoor greenery. One of their most exciting projects is the living indoor green wall, which was developed based on the explorer Humboldt.\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/img_9175_1.jpeg)\n\n\n### \nThe Humboldt Restaurant, located within the Therme Bucharest complex, is a stunning example of the company's commitment to sustainability and greenery. The restaurant's focal point is a lush vertical garden, which covers an entire wall and extends up to the ceiling. The greenery is not only beautiful to look at but also serves an important function in improving the air quality and creating a healthy ambiance in the space.\nThe living indoor green wall was developed using Therme's special vertical green wall system, which includes a mineral substrate that provides the plants with the necessary nutrients to grow. The system also uses a drip irrigation system that ensures the plants receive the right amount of water and nutrients at all times. This approach ensures that the greenery stays healthy and vibrant, even in an indoor environment.\n![Page Image 1](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/humboldt_foto1_7--photo_11--photo_2.jpg)\n\n\n### \nThe design of the green wall was inspired by the famous explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who was one of the first people to document the link between plant life and climate. Humboldt's explorations of the Amazon and other regions of South America in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were instrumental in developing our understanding of the natural world and the impact of human activity on it.\nThe green wall at the Humboldt Restaurant serves as a tribute to Humboldt's legacy and his emphasis on the importance of plants and greenery for a healthy planet. The wall features a wide range of plants, including ferns, bromeliads, and other species that are native to tropical regions of the world. The greenery is not only beautiful but also creates a natural air conditioning effect, which helps regulate the temperature and humidity in the space.\nIn addition to the living indoor green wall, the Humboldt Restaurant also features a range of other sustainable design features. The furniture and decor were made using eco-friendly materials, and the lighting system uses energy-efficient LED lights. The restaurant also serves a range of organic and locally sourced food, which further emphasizes Therme's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendliness.\n![Page Image 2](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/humboldt_foto1_7--photo_13--photo_2.jpg)\n\n\n### \nOne of the most significant benefits of the living indoor green wall is its ability to improve air quality in indoor environments. Indoor air pollution is a significant problem in many parts of the world, and it can lead to a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and headaches. The plants in the green wall act as natural air purifiers, removing harmful pollutants and toxins from the air and replacing them with fresh oxygen.\nResearch has shown that plants can also have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing. Exposure to greenery has been linked to reduced stress levels, improved mood, and increased productivity. The living indoor green wall at the Humboldt Restaurant creates a soothing and calming environment that helps visitors relax and unwind.\n![Page Image 3](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/img_9173_2.jpeg)\n\n\n### \nAnother benefit of the living indoor green wall is its ability to create a healthy ambiance in indoor environments. The greenery adds a natural and organic element to the space, which can be especially important in urban environments where people are often disconnected from nature. The plants also create a sense of tranquility and serenity, which can be particularly beneficial in high-stress environments such as offices and hospitals.\nThe living indoor green wall is just one example of Therme's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendliness. The company is also exploring other ways to incorporate greenery into its complexes, including rooftop gardens, green roofs, and other innovative design features. By prioritizing\n\n",

    "content": "## Tender GreenRiyad 2020 with BEC Arabia, (Saudi Arabia)\nTender GreenRiyad 2020: Transforming Saudi Arabia's Capital through Sustainable Nursery Development\nIn recent years, the world has become increasingly aware of the detrimental effects of climate change. From rising temperatures to more frequent natural disasters, the need to take action is more urgent than ever before. In response, governments around the world are making a concerted effort to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their carbon footprint.\nOne such government is Saudi Arabia, which has set an ambitious goal of transforming its capital, Riyad, into a green city. This initiative aims to combat the effects of climate change by introducing more plants and trees into the city, which will help to lower temperatures and improve air quality.\nTo achieve this goal, the Saudi government has launched Tender GreenRiyad 2020, one of the largest nursery development plans in the country. \n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/new-29-9-2020_6--foto.jpg)\n\n\n### \nThe project has a multi-faceted approach, with several key objectives. The first is to create a network of nurseries that will produce a wide range of plant and tree species. These nurseries will be located across the city, making it easier to transport the plants and trees to their final destinations. The second objective is to ensure that the plants and trees are sustainably grown, with a focus on using organic materials and minimizing waste.\nTo ensure the success of the project, the Saudi government is also investing in the latest technology and equipment. This includes advanced irrigation systems, automated plant-growing systems, and other tools that will help to ensure that the plants and trees are healthy and thrive in their new environment.\nThe benefits of Tender GreenRiyad 2020 are numerous. For one, the introduction of more greenery will help to lower temperatures in the city, which is especially important in the desert climate of Riyad. This will reduce the demand for energy-intensive air conditioning systems and improve the quality of life for residents. In addition, the increased greenery will help to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the city's carbon footprint and contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.\nFurthermore, the project will create new jobs in the region, particularly in the nursery and landscaping industries. This will have a positive impact on the local economy.\nIn conclusion, Tender GreenRiyad 2020 is an important initiative that has the potential to transform Saudi Arabia's capital into a green and sustainable city. With a focus on community involvement, sustainability, and the latest technology, the project is set to have a positive impact on the environment, the economy, and the quality of life for residents. As the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change, initiatives like this are essential to create a more sustainable future for all.\n\n",

    "content": "## Garden design high end client, Global\nGarden design is a creative process that requires both vision and technical expertise. When designing a garden for a high-end client, the stakes are even higher. Not only must the garden be beautiful and functional, but it must also reflect the client's personality and values. In this article, we will discuss the key elements of garden design for high-end clients, including the use of sustainable materials, large trees, and community involvement.\nSustainability is a key consideration for any modern garden design. High-end clients are often environmentally conscious and expect their gardens to reflect their values. Sustainable materials are a crucial element of any garden design for high-end clients. This can include the use of recycled materials such as reclaimed wood, metal, and glass, as well as locally sourced natural materials like stone, gravel, and plants. The goal is to minimize the environmental impact of the garden while maximizing its aesthetic and functional potential.\n![Page Image 0](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/high-end-clients2.jpg)\n\n\nAnother important element of garden design for high-end clients is the use of large trees. Trees are not only beautiful, but they also serve a variety of functions in a garden. They provide shade, reduce noise pollution, and improve air quality. High-end clients often have large properties, which means there is ample room for large trees. When selecting trees for a garden design, it is important to consider the climate, soil conditions, and the tree's growth habits. Some popular choices for large trees include oak, maple, and magnolia.\n\n\nCommunity involvement is another key element of garden design for high-end clients. Many high-end clients are passionate about giving back to their communities and want their gardens to be a place of shared enjoyment. This can involve designing spaces for community events, such as outdoor concerts or charity fundraisers. It can also involve incorporating elements that reflect the local community's culture and history, such as traditional artwork or indigenous plant species. By involving the community in the garden design process, high-end clients can create a space that is not only beautiful and functional but also meaningful and impactful.\n![Page Image 1](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/high-end-clients6.jpg)\n\n\nDesign is, of course, a crucial element of any garden design for high-end clients. High-end clients often have specific design preferences and expect their gardens to reflect their style and personality. Some popular design styles for high-end gardens include modern, minimalist, and classic. When designing a garden for a high-end client, it is important to consider the overall aesthetic of the property, as well as the client's personal preferences. The goal is to create a cohesive design that complements the client's lifestyle and reflects their unique personality.\nOne of the biggest challenges in garden design for high-end clients is balancing beauty and functionality. High-end clients often have very specific ideas about what they want in their gardens, and it can be a challenge to translate these ideas into a cohesive design that is both beautiful and functional. This is where the expertise of a professional garden designer comes into play. A skilled designer can work with the client to understand their needs and preferences, and then translate these into a design that is both visually stunning and practical.\n![Page Image 2](https://www.greenconceptors.com/images/1000x0/high-end-clients4.jpg)\n\n\nIn addition to design, there are many other factors to consider when designing a garden for a high-end client. Maintenance is a crucial element of any garden design, and high-end clients often have high expectations when it comes to the upkeep of their gardens. It is important to select plants and materials that are low maintenance and require minimal upkeep. This can include using native plants that are well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, as well as selecting materials that are durable and long-lasting.\nBudget is another important consideration when designing a garden for a high-end client. High-end clients often have large budgets for their garden projects, but it is still important to stay within the client's budgetary constraints. This requires careful planning and attention to detail, as well as a deep understanding of the costs associated with different design elements and materials.\n\n",
