        "content": "### Flower Auction Plantion, The Netherlands\nPlantion is a bustling marketplace for florists, landscapers, and retailers.\nEvery day in the early morning, florists purchase fresh, wonderfully fragrant products for their shops at the clock auction. Through personal contact, the mediation department connects buyers and growers.\nPlantion has been in existence since 2008, with the history of the underlying auctions dating back more than a hundred years. Many small, local auctions have merged over the years into larger regional marketplaces. In 2008, Bloemenveiling Oost Nederland and Veiling Vleuten merged to form Plantion, resulting in a new marketplace in Ede designed by Breddels Architects in 2010.\nWhen it became clear at the end of 2007 that our conceived space-saving stacked auction concept for Plantion in Ede was somewhat too daring, we reverted to optimizing and automating the traditional \"spread-out-type\" auction complex. In this 65,000 m² \"flat pancake,\" we sought an architectural counterpoint.\nWe designed a 300-meter-long ascending facade along the railway, spiraling into a curl reaching towards the sky at the A30 ramp. This curl symbolizes an intertwined 45-meter-high crown of a flower, alerting passersby to the core business of this modern marketplace. Beneath the crown are the crown offices located above the processing center and buyer boxes.\nIn 2023, a new multifunctional processing center of 6,250 m² was realized. With this, Plantion offers more facilities to customers, and logistical flows are also more efficiently organized. The expansion of the processing center seamlessly integrates with the existing building; the roofline of the new construction merges seamlessly with the existing structure. The existing prefabricated concrete plinths with leaf motif have been reused in the new construction.\nThe new processing center includes a loading dock with seven additional delivery docks and a large dispatch area. The sides of the docks are made of prefabricated concrete elements. The 6,250 m² expansion includes a delivery hall of 3,850 m², a shared cold storage of 150 m², and rentable box spaces with transport corridors of 2,250 m². With the delivery through this expansion, the distribution of goods in the existing large auction hall can be largely automated.\nThe new marketplace consists of five contiguous building parts:\nBuilding A contains the auction company with the dispatch, auction hall, a large auction room, a company restaurant, and offices.\nBuilding B contains the processing center, rentable box spaces, and crown offices for trading companies affiliated with the auction.\nBuilding C contains the loading hall where customers (florists and landscapers) can take their purchased items directly.\nBuilding D contains the Wholesale Center (plants, flowers, hydroponics, and hardware) and the Plantion Green Center.\nBuilding E contains a large delivery hall with a loading dock and rentable box spaces.\nThe auction room has a capacity of 400 buyers and is set up as an auditorium so that, along with the auction hall and adjoining restaurant space, it can also be used as a conference center outside of auction times.\nSustainability Plantion is built according to sustainable principles, considering minimal gas consumption and minimal CO2 emissions. Energy is obtained from a heat-cold storage system. Through pipe-carrying concrete floors, warm water is used for heating beneath the offices and the auction room. Walls and floors are fully insulated. Thanks to special plastic roofing, watering of the own flowers and plants (including the green center) with rainwater is possible. The water buffer serves as firewater supply, including for the sprinkler system in the auction complex.\nIn 2017, 18,500 solar panels (more than three soccer fields) were installed on the roof of Plantion, generating a capacity of 950 kWp. This is sufficient to have 25% of Plantion's total annual electricity consumption generated by solar energy. Besides providing a small economic advantage, this leads to a significant improvement in terms of CO2 emissions. The amount of CO2 emissions will decrease by 325 tons per year, with a total CO2 reduction of over 17,000 tons over twenty years.\nThis is one of the larger roof-mounted solar panel projects in the Netherlands to date. In addition to use for the own building, a limited amount of electricity will also be fed back into the grid.\nA quote from Plantion: \"We are very proud of our building in Ede. It is beautiful, light, and clean, and also easily accessible (A12-A30). But what makes it especially remarkable is its sustainable nature. Plantion doesn't use regular energy, but naturally heated and cooled water. Our building is also maximally insulated and equipped with solar panels. This saves costs and is good for the environment!\"",

At GreenConceptors, we believe that businesses have a responsibility to protect and enhance the environment, and we were delighted to work with Trespa® to bring this vision to life.\nThe Entrance we changed in a parc surrounded enviornment where the trees cover the building with colourfull leaves.\nWe partnered with Ebben nurseries, the largest tree nursery in the Netherlands, to create an optimal plan that would embrace nature and green the factory. Our plan was designed to create a green oasis in the heart of the industrial area, where Trespa's factory is located. We wanted to create an environment that would not only look beautiful, but would also have a positive impact on the local ecosystem.\nTo achieve this, we planted over 700 large trees as part of our plan. These trees have had an immediate impact on the green ambiance of the factory, creating a welcoming and calming environment for both employees and visitors. The trees have also helped to reduce the carbon footprint of the factory by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air.\n\n",

By using permeable materials for walkways and creating green areas, we were able to capture and retain rainwater, which can then be used to irrigate the plants on site. This not only helps to reduce the amount of water that needs to be taken from local sources, but it also helps to prevent flooding in the area.",

        "content": "## Waterdrinker Plant Center, The Netherlands\nThe Waterdrinker Plant Center symbolizes confidence in the future. This new building, with 27,000 m² of logistics space and 4,500 m² of offices, provides ample room for the growth and flourishing of the floriculture industry.\nWaterdrinker is the European market leader in the export of indoor and outdoor plants and, in collaboration with the FloraHolland flower auction, is developing a new trading area on the eastern side of the Aalsmeer auction. The Plant Center is the first building to rise here. Previously, Waterdrinker's export activities were spread across four different locations on the auction site, but the new construction brings them all together under one roof. This not only means more efficient logistics but also better climatic conditions and working environments.\nThe building is simple and efficient in design yet surprising in its details. A rectangular volume is clad with striking blue façade panels. On the ground floor, the logistics functions are housed, while the offices occupy the upper floor. Sawtooth roofs generously provide daylight for both people and plants. A large office garden offers plenty of space for pleasant and bright workspaces. Informal meeting places can be found in the corridors. Additionally, there are separate meeting and boardrooms and a flexible presentation space, easily adaptable for various setups. The cafeteria directly adjoins a secluded rooftop garden.\nWarm and mostly natural materials have been chosen for the interior finishes. For example, the staircase and entrance are finished with wood. Floral motifs on the carpet allude to what this place is really all about.",

        "content": "## A Futuristic Vision Unfolding in Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia's ambition for technological innovation and economic diversification is boldly epitomized by NEOM, a groundbreaking project that promises to redefine the future of urban living and sustainable development. At the heart of this endeavor lies the NEOM Media Park, where we've had the privilege to contribute to its design, marking a pivotal step in shaping the landscape of tomorrow.\nNEOM, spanning across 26,500 square kilometers in the northwestern region of Saudi Arabia, is envisioned as a futuristic metropolis blending cutting-edge technology with sustainable living. With a focus on sectors like energy, biotechnology, tourism, and media, NEOM aims to become a global hub for innovation and investment, driving economic growth and fostering a dynamic ecosystem for businesses and residents alike.\nThe NEOM Media Park represents a crucial component of this grand vision, poised to revolutionize the media landscape in the region and beyond. As part of the design team, we were entrusted with crafting spaces that not only embody innovation and creativity but also reflect the cultural heritage and values of Saudi Arabia. From state-of-the-art studios to collaborative workspaces, every aspect of the Media Park is meticulously planned to inspire collaboration, innovation, and excellence in media production and content creation.\nOne of the key principles guiding the design process is sustainability. NEOM is committed to achieving carbon neutrality and preserving the natural environment, and the Media Park is no exception. Green spaces, renewable energy sources, and eco-friendly infrastructure are seamlessly integrated into the design, ensuring minimal environmental impact and maximum efficiency.\nMoreover, the Media Park is designed to foster inclusivity and diversity, welcoming talents from around the world to contribute to its vibrant media ecosystem. It will serve as a platform for creativity and expression, facilitating the exchange of ideas and narratives that transcend borders and cultures.\nIn addition to its economic and cultural significance, the NEOM Media Park holds immense potential to drive social transformation and empowerment. By providing opportunities for skill development, education, and entrepreneurship, it aims to empower Saudi youth and women, equipping them with the tools and resources to thrive in the digital age.\nAs NEOM continues to take shape, it represents a beacon of hope and possibility for Saudi Arabia and the world. It embodies the spirit of innovation, resilience, and collaboration, offering a glimpse into a future where technology serves humanity and sustainability is the cornerstone of progress.\nIn conclusion, our involvement in the design of the NEOM Media Park is not just a testament to our expertise but also a testament to our shared commitment to shaping a better future. Together with our partners and collaborators, we look forward to witnessing the transformative impact of NEOM and the Media Park on the global stage.",

With the help of experienced designers and architects, the Borghuis family is all set to create a unique circular building that will set a new standard in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency.\nThe project is aimed at optimizing the existing garden center, by adding a new cold house and turning the old cold house into a warm area by changing the roof and adding energy-saving installations. The building will also feature a new in-store design, routing optimization, and shelving plan to enhance customer experience and convenience.",

The project is a perfect example of how businesses can contribute to a more sustainable future by incorporating circular building practices in their operations.\nCircular building is a relatively new concept that aims to reduce waste and increase resource efficiency by designing buildings that are adaptable, reusable, and designed to minimize environmental impact. It involves designing buildings that are energy-efficient, use sustainable materials, and can be easily dismantled and reused at the end of their lifespan. The concept is gaining popularity globally as more and more businesses realize the importance of sustainability in their operations.\nThe Intratuin Zwolle project is a perfect example of how circular building principles can be applied to a commercial project. The building will be constructed using sustainable materials and energy-efficient installations, ensuring that it minimizes its carbon footprint. The addition of a new cold house and the conversion of the old one into a warm area will also help to optimize the use of space and reduce energy consumption.",

However, like many cities, there are areas that have been forgotten and neglected over time. It is always exciting when an opportunity arises to renew these areas and bring new life to them. Recently, we had the privilege of working on a concept design for our client to renew an area of the city that had been forgotten.\nThe area we were tasked with renewing was already a popular spot for people to recreate and play. However, it lacked a certain charm and identity that would make it truly special. We set out to design a concept that would not only enhance the area but also create a unique experience for visitors.",

        "content": "One of the key features of our design was the addition of a Japanese botanical garden on higher ground. This garden not only provided a beautiful and serene space for visitors to escape the hustle and bustle of the city but also offered breathtaking views of the valley below. The design of the garden incorporated traditional Japanese landscaping techniques such as rock gardens, water features, and carefully curated plant selections.\nThe botanical garden was designed to be a multi-seasonal attraction. In the spring, visitors could enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms, while in the summer, they could escape the heat by walking among the shaded trees and taking in the views from the top of the hill. During the fall, the changing colors of the leaves would provide a stunning backdrop, while in the winter, the garden would be transformed into a winter wonderland with carefully placed lighting and snow-covered trees.\nIn addition to the botanical garden, we also restored an old and forgotten stage in the area to create an outdoor theatre. The theatre was designed to be an intimate space that would allow visitors to enjoy music, plays, and other performances in a unique and memorable setting. The stage was carefully restored to its former glory, and new seating areas were added to provide a comfortable experience for visitors.",

        "content": "The outdoor theatre was designed with versatility in mind. The stage area could be transformed into a dance floor for events such as weddings or other celebrations, while the seating areas could be rearranged to accommodate larger or smaller crowds. The theatre was also designed to be fully accessible, with ramps and designated seating areas for those with mobility needs.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this project was the opportunity to work with local artists and artisans to incorporate their work into the design. We commissioned several large-scale art installations that would be displayed throughout the area, providing a unique and immersive experience for visitors. The art installations were designed to be interactive and thought-provoking, encouraging visitors to engage with the space in new and creative ways.\nAnother important aspect of our design was sustainability. We incorporated several eco-friendly features such as rainwater harvesting, solar lighting, and composting facilities. We also worked with local businesses to source materials and labor, supporting the local economy and reducing our carbon footprint.",

The restaurant's focal point is a lush vertical garden, which covers an entire wall and extends up to the ceiling. The greenery is not only beautiful to look at but also serves an important function in improving the air quality and creating a healthy ambiance in the space.\nThe living indoor green wall was developed using Therme's special vertical green wall system, which includes a mineral substrate that provides the plants with the necessary nutrients to grow. The system also uses a drip irrigation system that ensures the plants receive the right amount of water and nutrients at all times. This approach ensures that the greenery stays healthy and vibrant, even in an indoor environment.",

Humboldt's explorations of the Amazon and other regions of South America in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were instrumental in developing our understanding of the natural world and the impact of human activity on it.\nThe green wall at the Humboldt Restaurant serves as a tribute to Humboldt's legacy and his emphasis on the importance of plants and greenery for a healthy planet. The wall features a wide range of plants, including ferns, bromeliads, and other species that are native to tropical regions of the world. The greenery is not only beautiful but also creates a natural air conditioning effect, which helps regulate the temperature and humidity in the space.\nIn addition to the living indoor green wall, the Humboldt Restaurant also features a range of other sustainable design features. The furniture and decor were made using eco-friendly materials, and the lighting system uses energy-efficient LED lights. The restaurant also serves a range of organic and locally sourced food, which further emphasizes Therme's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendliness.",

The plants in the green wall act as natural air purifiers, removing harmful pollutants and toxins from the air and replacing them with fresh oxygen.\nResearch has shown that plants can also have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing.

From rising temperatures to more frequent natural disasters, the need to take action is more urgent than ever before. In response, governments around the world are making a concerted effort to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their carbon footprint.\nOne such government is Saudi Arabia, which has set an ambitious goal of transforming its capital, Riyad, into a green city. This initiative aims to combat the effects of climate change by introducing more plants and trees into the city, which will help to lower temperatures and improve air quality.\nTo achieve this goal, the Saudi government has launched Tender GreenRiyad 2020, one of the largest nursery development plans in the country.

        "content": "### \nThe project has a multi-faceted approach, with several key objectives. The first is to create a network of nurseries that will produce a wide range of plant and tree species. These nurseries will be located across the city, making it easier to transport the plants and trees to their final destinations. The second objective is to ensure that the plants and trees are sustainably grown, with a focus on using organic materials and minimizing waste.\nTo ensure the success of the project, the Saudi government is also investing in the latest technology and equipment. This includes advanced irrigation systems, automated plant-growing systems, and other tools that will help to ensure that the plants and trees are healthy and thrive in their new environment.\nThe benefits of Tender GreenRiyad 2020 are numerous. For one, the introduction of more greenery will help to lower temperatures in the city, which is especially important in the desert climate of Riyad. This will reduce the demand for energy-intensive air conditioning systems and improve the quality of life for residents. In addition, the increased greenery will help to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the city's carbon footprint and contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.\nFurthermore, the project will create new jobs in the region, particularly in the nursery and landscaping industries. This will have a positive impact on the local economy.\nIn conclusion, Tender GreenRiyad 2020 is an important initiative that has the potential to transform Saudi Arabia's capital into a green and sustainable city. With a focus on community involvement, sustainability, and the latest technology, the project is set to have a positive impact on the environment, the economy, and the quality of life for residents. As the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change, initiatives like this are essential to create a more sustainable future for all.",

When designing a garden for a high-end client, the stakes are even higher. Not only must the garden be beautiful and functional, but it must also reflect the client's personality and values. In this article, we will discuss the key elements of garden design for high-end clients, including the use of sustainable materials, large trees, and community involvement.\nSustainability is a key consideration for any modern garden design. High-end clients are often environmentally conscious and expect their gardens to reflect their values. Sustainable materials are a crucial element of any garden design for high-end clients. This can include the use of recycled materials such as reclaimed wood, metal, and glass, as well as locally sourced natural materials like stone, gravel, and plants. The goal is to minimize the environmental impact of the garden while maximizing its aesthetic and functional potential.",

        "content": "Another important element of garden design for high-end clients is the use of large trees. Trees are not only beautiful, but they also serve a variety of functions in a garden. They provide shade, reduce noise pollution, and improve air quality. High-end clients often have large properties, which means there is ample room for large trees. When selecting trees for a garden design, it is important to consider the climate, soil conditions, and the tree's growth habits. Some popular choices for large trees include oak, maple, and magnolia.\n\n\nCommunity involvement is another key element of garden design for high-end clients. Many high-end clients are passionate about giving back to their communities and want their gardens to be a place of shared enjoyment. This can involve designing spaces for community events, such as outdoor concerts or charity fundraisers. It can also involve incorporating elements that reflect the local community's culture and history, such as traditional artwork or indigenous plant species. By involving the community in the garden design process, high-end clients can create a space that is not only beautiful and functional but also meaningful and impactful.",

        "content": "Design is, of course, a crucial element of any garden design for high-end clients. High-end clients often have specific design preferences and expect their gardens to reflect their style and personality. Some popular design styles for high-end gardens include modern, minimalist, and classic. When designing a garden for a high-end client, it is important to consider the overall aesthetic of the property, as well as the client's personal preferences. The goal is to create a cohesive design that complements the client's lifestyle and reflects their unique personality.\nOne of the biggest challenges in garden design for high-end clients is balancing beauty and functionality. High-end clients often have very specific ideas about what they want in their gardens, and it can be a challenge to translate these ideas into a cohesive design that is both beautiful and functional. This is where the expertise of a professional garden designer comes into play. A skilled designer can work with the client to understand their needs and preferences, and then translate these into a design that is both visually stunning and practical.",

Maintenance is a crucial element of any garden design, and high-end clients often have high expectations when it comes to the upkeep of their gardens. It is important to select plants and materials that are low maintenance and require minimal upkeep. This can include using native plants that are well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, as well as selecting materials that are durable and long-lasting.\nBudget is another important consideration when designing a garden for a high-end client. High-end clients often have large budgets for their garden projects, but it is still important to stay within the client's budgetary constraints. This requires careful planning and attention to detail, as well as a deep understanding of the costs associated with different design elements and materials.",

The garden centre has several zones, including the entrance, the parking lot, the outdoor sales area, the nursery, and the indoor sales area. Each of these zones has different requirements in terms of customer flow, access, and visibility. GreenConceptors identified the strengths and weaknesses of each zone and looked for opportunities to improve the routing.\n\nThe next step was to create a design that would enhance the customer experience. The design needed to be functional, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to navigate. GreenConceptors used their expertise in landscape architecture and urban design to create a design that would achieve these goals. They used a combination of natural and artificial elements to create a visually appealing outdoor area.\n\nOne of the main challenges of the project was to create a balance between product and plants. The garden centre has a wide range of products, including garden furniture, barbecues, and outdoor lighting. However, the primary focus of the garden centre is plants. GreenConceptors needed to create a routing that would showcase the plants while still giving customers access to the other products.",

        "content": "To achieve this balance, GreenConceptors created a routing that would lead customers through the plant area first. The plant area is located at the centre of the outdoor area, surrounded by the other zones. Customers would enter the outdoor area through the entrance and be led through the plant area, where they would see the various plants and flowers available at the garden centre.\n\nAfter passing through the plant area, customers would then be directed towards the other zones, such as the outdoor sales area, the nursery, and the indoor sales area. The routing was designed to be fluid and easy to navigate, with clear signage and visual cues to guide customers. The overall design of the routing was intended to create a sense of discovery and exploration, encouraging customers to explore the different areas of the garden centre.\n\nThe design also took into consideration the different seasons and the changing needs of the garden centre. In the summer, for example, the outdoor sales area would be the primary focus, with a wide range of products on display. In the winter, the indoor sales area would be more important, with a range of seasonal products and indoor plants.\n\nGreenConceptors also looked at ways to enhance the overall customer experience. They created a seating area in the plant area, where customers could sit and relax while admiring the plants. They also created a play area for children, with a range of activities and games to keep them entertained.\n\nThe final design of the outdoor area routing was a great success. It created a clear and easy-to-follow routing for customers while showcasing the beauty of the plants and products available at the garden centre. The design was also functional, with clear signage and visual cues to guide customers.\n\nIn conclusion, the project to optimize the outdoor routing of Intratuin Nuenen was a great success. GreenConceptors used their expertise in landscape architecture and urban design",

The entrepreneurs had a vision of creating a space that would not only be beautiful but also sustainable. They wanted to showcase the possibilities of urban green spaces and demonstrate the positive impact they can have on people's lives. By creating a rooftop garden, they were able to achieve this goal while also providing a unique and exciting space for visitors.\nOne of the key features of the rooftop garden is the windmill that pumps up water to irrigate plants. This is a prime example of how the entrepreneurs at Ebben tree nursery have used innovative technologies to create a sustainable space. The windmill generates energy that is then used to pump up water from a reservoir, which is then used to irrigate the plants. This reduces the amount of energy required to water the plants, making the rooftop garden more sustainable and eco-friendly. The 3D printed circulair lightweight benches give the project an extra green-touch!\nThe rooftop garden also includes a test area for biodiversity, which is a collaboration between Ebben tree nursery, Naturalis, Leiden University and Technical University Delft. The test area is designed to help researchers understand how different plant species interact with each other and with the environment. This information can then be used to create more sustainable urban green spaces that support a wide range of biodiversity.",

        "content": "## Gran Flora Auction Holambra, Brazil\nIn early December 2012, Breddels Architects received an email from Brazil. They were asked if they were interested in a project, similar to the wholesale center of Plantion in Ede, which had been operational for almost three years at that time. Less than two weeks later, the week before Christmas, they were on-site, analyzing the task, the current situation, and the possibilities.\nThe still-new Holambra auction (2009) was already nearly 90,000 m² in size, well-designed, and rapidly growing. There was a need for a wholesale center (Cash & Carry) as a complement to the auction to strengthen its position as a marketplace. Currently, only products from cooperative members were being auctioned, and to become a \"one-stop shopping marketplace,\" the range needed to be expanded with many more products from elsewhere, including flowers, plants, and hardware (accessories).\nThey explored three variant locations and developed a concept that they presented to the board after three days. The concept could be implemented in two or three phases with flexibility to accommodate future experiences. They utilized the natural terrain contouring by placing parking and loading under the center. Significant advantages of this approach included relatively cool and dry loading areas, short walking distances without cars needing to be in the center itself, and buyers entering the heart of the center.\nOther essential design aspects included integrating outdoor plants (Ornamental Plants) into the building with a movable double roof for both shade and rain protection. To maintain uniformity among these building parts, they designed a special facade initially with a natural bamboo appearance.\nFurther research revealed that this facade would look poor within two years due to intense sun exposure. Therefore, they designed steel wing profiles in 7-tones colors with occasional corporate orange accents. These accents were irregularly spaced to create a lively and dynamic appearance.\nIn January 2013, they received the joyful news that their concept was embraced, and they could begin detailed planning.\nIn February 2013, they traveled again to Brazil to present the design. A month later, they returned, this time with their technical project leader, to investigate local construction techniques to further develop the design. For example, they explored a framework for double T-beams where they were not available or too expensive.\nDuring this time, they met their amiable Brazilian colleague architect, José Antonio Torezan, who would handle the permit process and daily construction supervision. Two more follow-up visits were made for coordination and implementation of user requirements.\nConstruction began in June 2013, and on July 16, 2014, the new wholesale center was ceremonially opened.",
