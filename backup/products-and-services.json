By using special lighting that keeps plants healthy, we were able to create an outdoor experience indoors. The results were amazing. We are privileged to work for several Dutch television programmes. We create a natural atmosphere on stage by adding plants.\n\nWith project planting we take care of the total interior styling with plants.\n\nIf you need project plants for your office or any other kind of project, let us know.",

        "content": "Greenconceptors has worked together with many zoo architects and zoo product suppliers which means that we have knowledge on how to add greenery and glasshouse constructions to your zoo.\n\n### Zoo plants supply\n\nWe can tell you which plants are suitable for a specific indoor or outdoor animal habitat. We can help you design in detail the best plant for the right place and of course what products you could use to get the right result. Animal welfare is of course the most import subject that we are taking care of during the development of your plan.\n\n### Botanical glasshouse and Greenhouse design:\n\nWhen considering the functionality of your new Zoo or botanical glasshouse, it is important to ensure that the structure performs accordingly and that its implementation can eventually exceed expectations. What considerations need to be made and what you have to think about prior to the building? As with anything in life, thorough preparation is half the battle won. The time put into the preliminary phase of building your greenhouse is a great investment in its future use. Botanical glasshouses have an increasingly public function and there is a demand for them to be attractive for different types of visitors. It is very important that you begin by listing the expectations your animals and visitors have of your glasshouse.\n\nConsider the function, animal welfare, shape, look and feel, climate requirements, routing and other necessary facilities. What outcome do you want from your glasshouse and as such, what features does it require?\n\nThink about your current requirements in relation to your potential future requirements. In addition to being able to provide an ideal climate for your flora and animals but also visitors welfare. Botanical glasshouses are all about interactivity and the complete experience. These all influence the choice of light, temperature, installations and other features etc. and have an impact on the overall outcome and success of the glasshouse.\n\nIs your glasshouse geared towards a natural experience for the general public that will visit your Zoo? Are your different temperature zones well defined?\n\nOnce you have defined the required functions for your botanical glasshouse, you can begin to consider your specific light requirements. A desert garden will need more light than a restaurant for example, where controlled light is key.\n\nDifferent temperature zones and thus installations and routing can be ideally aligned. Hence, an innovative division of temperatures within your glasshouse will ultimately mean higher energy savings and overall optimization of your glasshouse performance. The GreenConceptors are together with our partners able in giving you the best price quality solution so together we can develop a Masterplan that will be helpful during the total development of your Zoo and botanical garden.\n\n### Butterfly garden\n\nBotanical zoos have a different aspect to them, namely good care for plants, humans and most importantly animals! Not all animals have the same amount of ultraviolet needs. Butterflies for example use ultraviolet for coordination. They dance, as it were, in the air in a specific rhythm at a certain height. When the roofing of a butterfly garden is built too low, butterflies cannot dance to that specific rhythm at that height anymore. This causes butterflies to move less or even to just sit against the roofing. Another important issue is the ventilation windows. It is not desirable that butterflies or birds get stuck in the construction, the use of netting is therefore often necessary. But what type of netting do you use? All kind of questions that we are able to answer due to our knowledge in botanical glasshouse design. If you want to design a jungle or dry-land landscape, we are able to help.\n\n### Insect screening\n\nBesides netting there are a variety of other methods to keep insects and small winged insects inside, for example placing ‘Harmonica’ systems between the windows. These systems use thin gauze which unfolds whenever the windows are opened for ventilation. This advanced system was developed for keeping in bumble-bees that pollinate flowers in greenhouses. We can implement these systems during the development of botanical zoo greenhouses.\n\n### Reptile greenhouse\n\nReptiles need a lot of ultraviolet light to keep their shells in good condition. A material that lets this light through is ETFE foil. This material can be installed in different cushions and layers by which a optimal climate is created in the greenhouse with as much light as possible.\n\n### The right material to choose\n\nGlass, ETFE foil, Polycarbonate all materials can be used in various forms, for example cushions of ETFE foil, which allows constructions to me made in many different beautiful shapes can be used. The ETFE cushions also insulate the construction.\n\nThe designs of ETFE buildings often have unique shapes. ETFE constructions are more flexible than standard greenhouses but are often harder to ventilate. The climate control of a standard greenhouse construction is in many cases already optimal due to years of development in greenhouse cultivation. The huge amount of windows makes sure there is a large natural ventilation capacity available.\n\nBut what material is the best to choose? Curious about the pros and cons? Don’t hesitate to contact us.\n\n### [**CONTACT**](http://www.greenconceptors.com/contact/)",

        "content": "What is the story you want to tell? Every concept has a beginning and an end.\n\nA powerful concept must have a clear message and emotionally deliver this message to the consumers.\n\nA few questions that frequently arise during the development of a concept are:\n\n- What story do you want to tell?\n- What is the message that you want to deliver to the consumers?\n- What are the target markets you want to serve?\n- In what way and where are consumers present?\n- Is the present way of approaching consumers the right way?\n- What is your distinctiveness?\n- How will you become different to the already existing competition?\n\nThese are all themes the Greenconceptors take into account during the development of a concept. Intrigued about our vision on the development of a concept? Please contact us and we will gladly perform an analysis on your concept and look for areas to improve on together. \n\nOur in-house developed **3D design system** enables us to visualise your project in 3D. This way we can look for errors in the combination of the greenhouse construction and the design of your project together. This provides clarity to you as an entrepreneur, but also gives the ability to enthuse your staff about your new construction or renovation. \n\n**3D visualisation** does not only give more insight, but also provides an optimisation during the project development/construction period. Calculations are made in advance on how many products are needed and how much material is required.\n\n**3D animation** has a cost reducing effect during the realisation of a project. ",

The green outdoor space is directly brought into contact with indoor greenery by using glass. The effect of connecting nature from the outside to the inside is mostly only possible with the realisation of a botanical greenhouse conservatory. Besides the English, French and German botanical greenhouses, the Dutch agricultural greenhouse construction is one of the best specialisms in the world. The combination of new agricultural greenhouse construction techniques combined with botanical glasshouses makes it possible to realize incredibly well acclimatised projects. The use of the centuries-old greenhouse construction knowledge, which the botanical conservatory glasshouses are well known for, combined with the latest Dutch agricultural greenhouse construction methods is unique. Screening-Climate control: The climate in a botanical greenhouse is not only crucial for the plants that grow here but must also be bearable for visitors and employees. Using shade cloths and natural ventilation techniques, for example, an optimal climate can be ensured. The plants can grow and people can enjoy the magnificent indoor nature that has been created in the glasshouse.",

They are not only aesthetically pleasing, but they also offer a range of benefits such as reducing the urban heat island effect, providing insulation, and promoting biodiversity. In addition to these benefits, rooftop gardens provide a space for people to relax, socialize, and even grow their own food. In this article, we will explore the advantages of rooftop gardens, the considerations that need to be taken into account when designing one, and the materials and techniques that can be used to create a successful rooftop garden.\n\nAdvantages of Rooftop Gardens: One of the primary advantages of rooftop gardens is their ability to reduce the urban heat island effect. The urban heat island effect occurs when buildings and pavement absorb and radiate heat, resulting in higher temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. Rooftop gardens help to reduce this effect by providing shade, insulation, and transpiration. The plants in the garden absorb sunlight, which reduces the amount of heat that is absorbed by the roof. Additionally, the plants release water vapor through transpiration, which cools the air around the plants.",

        "content": "Another advantage of rooftop gardens is their ability to provide insulation. Plants on the roof help to absorb and insulate the building from the sun's rays, which can reduce energy consumption for cooling during hot weather. In the winter, the plants help to insulate the building, reducing heating costs.\n\nRooftop gardens can also help to promote biodiversity in urban areas. The plants provide a habitat for insects, birds, and other animals that might not have a place to live in an urban environment. In addition, rooftop gardens can help to filter pollutants from the air, which can improve air quality in the surrounding area.\n\nConsiderations for Rooftop Garden Design: When designing a rooftop garden, there are several considerations that need to be taken into account. Firstly, the weight of the garden needs to be considered, as roofs are not designed to support the weight of a garden. This means that lightweight materials need to be used and the weight of the soil, plants, and other features need to be carefully calculated.\n\nAnother consideration is the wind exposure on the roof. Rooftop gardens are often exposed to strong winds, which can damage plants and features. Windbreaks can be installed to protect the garden, but the design of the garden needs to take into account the wind patterns in the area.\n\nThe type of plants that can be used in a rooftop garden is also an important consideration. Plants need to be able to tolerate the harsh conditions on a roof, such as high temperatures, strong winds, and limited soil depth. Succulents, grasses, and small shrubs are often used in rooftop gardens as they are able to tolerate these conditions.",

Lightweight soil mixes are often used to reduce the weight of the garden, and drip irrigation systems can be used to conserve water.\n\nGreen roofs are often used in rooftop garden design. A green roof is a layer of vegetation that is planted on a waterproof membrane. This type of roof provides insulation, reduces the urban heat island effect, and can even reduce stormwater runoff.\n\nIf a green roof is not possible, containers can be used to grow plants on the roof. Containers are lightweight and can be easily moved if needed. They can also be used to create different levels and areas within the garden.\n\nConclusion: Rooftop gardens offer a range of benefits and can be a valuable addition to any property. When designing a rooftop garden, careful consideration needs to be given to the weight of the garden, wind exposure, and the types of plants that can be used.

Firstly, roof gardens create space for greenery in urban areas. Roof gardens and green façades also make a significant contribution to capturing particulates, ecology and reducing the Urban Heat Island effect. Of course it's important to make a carefully considered choice for species that lend themselves to use on roofs when making a selection. And matters such as watering systems and substrates also need to be taken directly into account in the planting plan.\n\n**History of roof gardens:**\n\nIt all started with sedum roofs to provide insulation. Roof gardens are now being implemented on a larger and larger scale and whole rooftop parks are even being created. Hectares of green space with creative planting and mature trees rising high above the building. But, do the positive effects of roof gardens weigh up against the supposed negative aspects?",

It's not much different to growing a tree in an urban environment. They're in containers on streets too - their growing space is limited. Of course on a roof you do need to take the choice of species into account. A tree of heaven or Robinia should not be placed on a roof, the strong roots would eventually damage the roofing material. What you see with tall standard trees is that it's difficult to prevent wind damage. The crown can be unbalanced by a broken branch. Multi-stem trees, on the other hand, retain their character even if a large branch is broken. The same goes for topiary trees - the annual pruning means these trees continue to renew themselves and are literally kept in shape.",

Trees will grow better here than on a high roof garden with lots of wind and a thinner layer. But it's important not to have the illusion that a tree can be completely grown in a roof garden. It's best to plant roof gardens with specimens in their final state and then maintain these carefully.\n\n**The management of roof gardens is a specialist field.**\n\nThe management of a roof garden is certainly a separate skill, there's a lot of ignorance. We have seen trees that had to be anchored to the roof, so a mechanical ground drill was used to make holes for the tree posts. The trees were very firmly secured but, of course, the roof was also ruined. You don't just see problems with management but also with the use of roof gardens. People don't understand the construction beneath a roof garden. Some students thought it would be great fun to pitch their tents in their university's roof garden using tent pegs. So managers have a task ahead of them in educating other people.",

        "content": "It all starts with good design. With the right plants in the right place, many problems can be avoided. You have to create a situation that's as natural as possible, which means you need to ensure sufficient water, rooting space, oxygen and nutrition. After that, the management of a roof garden isn't that different from one on open ground. The trees in a roof garden need to be thinned so that the crowns don't become too heavy. This means some knowledge of successful pruning is necessary.\n\n**Roofs with planting will always leak in the long term.**\n\nThis doesn't have to happen, but unfortunately sometimes it does. The cause is often a lack of expertise. The roofs load limit is tested and exceeded. And even if you did everything right technically, if plants with aggressive roots are added, it's just a matter of time before there's a leak. A growing space that is too narrow can also lead to problems. If a tree has too little space to grow, it will search for more space in order to survive. This can mean that the roots search for weak spots in the roofing.\n\nRoof gardens certainly don't always leak, there are plenty of examples that show the opposite. It all comes down to the correct roofing construction. If the roof is going to leak, there is always an identifiable, often minor, cause. You often see a roof being used as a glorified building site when construction commences. It should first be completely emptied and every square metre should be evaluated by a specialist. It should then be tested for water-tightness. If it is well constructed and a knowledgeable manager is appointed, there won't be any unpleasant surprises.\n\n**Watering roof planting costs a fortune.**\n\nThere should be a water buffer of five to seven centimetres in the substrate. This buffer is formed of rain water, which provides the plants not only with water but also with food. You have to create a situation that approximates nature as closely as possible. There is also a water buffer in the soil in a natural environment. If you design a roof garden in such a way that the rain water is drained off straight away, you will need to water the plants far too much to keep them alive.\n\nFor the drainage of water we use the best system:",

But if you don't start, you won't get anywhere. Intensive roof gardens should really be compulsory in the development of new buildings. And by intensive, I mean a lot of greenery. I would like to see large rooftop parks on company buildings. These can be combined very successfully with a garden for employees or a children's nursery with a playground.\n\nMore and more paving is being introduced in cities, so there is less and less space for trees. So roof gardens could make an important contribution to reducing the Urban Heat Island effect. Companies really need to appreciate their added value so this angle isn’t going to convince them. That's why we need to make roof gardens multifunctional. The more functions, the more important it is to keep your roof garden well maintained. You also have to ensure that the roof garden is easy to maintain, to reduce the management. Of course this is true of everything, from a roof garden to a coffee machine.\n\n**Roof planting contributes to ecology.**\n\nBirds and insects love them. The water storage capacity of roof gardens is also important. The rain water is filtered and the evaporation of the water cools the area. A city with a lot of roof gardens really feels cooler. You also see that the younger generation is more aware of the environment and that ecology increasingly plays a role in multifunctional roof gardens. More and more people want to grow their own vegetables and fruit. A properly constructed roof garden is particularly suitable for this and therefore serves various purposes. Vegetable gardens are somewhat romanticised in the media but, in principal, it's a good idea to grow your own vegetables in a roof garden.\n\nRoof planting makes an important contribution to ecology and improving the microclimate, but we need to stop extolling the virtues of vegetable gardens on roofs. There's currently a lot of hype surrounding purity and getting back to nature. If you look back at history over a long period, you can see that this always happens when the economy is poor. The environment then becomes important and farmers become our heroes. As soon as the economy picks up again, it's all forgotten and we're left with a rotting container of kale on the roof.",

But we are becoming more and more aware of the environment. People who can spare the time will be increasingly likely to choose a vegetable garden on the roof. From my viewpoint, this is not linked to the economy and is a lot more to do with urbanisation and the desire to create a piece of green in the city that will literally bear fruit.\n\nA roof garden should be functional and the basis should be good. You have to give it a heart. Otherwise it will slowly die. A vegetable garden requires intensive maintenance and it's not honestly much to look at. If you want a vegetable garden you have to make sure it's part of a very good combination. And when you lose interest, the birds should be able to eat everything so there's no mess and nothing has gone to waste.\n\n**Roof planting: a blessing or a curse?**\n\nOf course they are a blessing. It's embedded in our genes to create a little green in the strangest possible places, just look at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. We need vegetation, our grey environment needs more greenery and our greying population needs more green too!\n\nPeople need a green environment to live in and to stay healthy. Roof gardens contribute to more green and allow us to experience the seasons. They improve the microclimate and bring human scale back to urban environments. The value of buildings increases when more greenery is added to them or near them, that's a fact. But alongside all these arguments, we mustn't forget that people often really enjoy roof gardens, even if they don't know why. And this user experience is extremely important.\n\nIf you need more information about Roof Gardens, send us an email: [info@greenconceptors.com](mailto:info@greenconceptors.com)\n",

        "content": "## Vertical green wall design\n\nThe colour green makes people more calm and relaxed. Adding vertical greenery is one of the most efficient tools to directly improve your indoor environment. Vertical gardens and hanging gardens are one of our specialisms.\n\nTo build a good vertical garden in your specific location you need a lot of experience and knowledge about different types of climates, shading, plants and soil.\n\nWe build all over the world for (almost;) any budget. When you have the right system, the right plants, the right lights you will have the best result.\n\nWe help you in building your special wall. \n\nPlant walls reduce noise, clean the air of dust, improve air quality by stabilizing humidity levels, stimulate job satisfaction, higher concentration levels, reduce stress, promote creativity etc.\nThe result of being surrounded by greenery is clear. We just feel better!\n\nGreen is good for many things. Good for the soul, good for the indoor environment and good for your health. A green wall is the optimal way to ensure the working environment, well-being and health fit extremely well into modern architecture, which is often characterised by steel, concrete and glass.\n\nGreenconceptors helps you  to improve the indoor environment with increased humidity, reduces noice, creates a soothing organic environment and reduces stress and sick leave.\n\nGreenConceptors can help you create an environment that makes everyone feel welcome and healthy. The vertical green walls can improve your indoor climate and working environment. \n\n## **Clean & Waterproof system**\n\n## Easy to setup and use\n\n## Environmentally friendly by saving water and fertilizers\n\nThe drip irrigation system means 100% control of the watering, avoids drying out the top plants and waters the lower ones. There is a water reservoir at the bottom of the pot. The built-in water reservoir means that the plants only need to be watered about every three weeks. If the water level goes over the edge of the water reservoir, the water is drained through a grate to the pipe that connects all the pots.\n\nAny surplus water from one plant does not flow to other plants on the wall. This prevents the spread of any diseases and avoids over-watering. The irrigation method makes the system very reliable and ensures optimal growth conditions\nfor the plants, no matter where in the green wall they are located.",

        "content": "**Intratuin Zwolle**\n\nFor many Garden centres we discuss together with the entrepreneur possibilities about an optimal routing. With our own 3D animation program we made it possible to show what the new store could look like.\n\nBy using new techniques, simulate possibilities we speed up the decision making progress. The store focusses on the communication and sales of green products, by building a patio in the centre of the store a real green core was created. Having the possibility to design the building and instore routing and instore supplies makes it possible to develop a total masterplan for your store. The possibility to deliver a total masterplan, build and develop your total project makes us unique in the market.\n\n## We work in different phases to get to the optimal end result.\n\n## 1. Analyse phase - External analysis:\n\nExternal analysis is an essential step in the analysis phase of optimizing your store. It involves looking at the external factors that can impact your business. These factors can include competition, target market, and location. By conducting a thorough external analysis, you can get a good understanding of the market and what you need to do to stand out.\n\nOne of the first things to consider when conducting an external analysis is your target area. This includes looking at the local demographics, such as age, income, and education level, as well as the geography of the area. By understanding your target area, you can tailor your marketing and store layout to suit the needs of the local population.\n\nCompetitor analysis is also a critical part of external analysis. You need to know who your competitors are, what they are offering, and how they are marketing themselves. This information can help you identify gaps in the market that you can exploit and develop unique selling propositions that differentiate you from the competition.\n\nAnother important consideration is your target group. Who are your ideal customers, and what are their needs and preferences? By understanding your target group, you can develop marketing campaigns and product offerings that cater to their needs and preferences.\n\nHousehold analysis is also a crucial part of external analysis. You need to know how many households are in your target area, their income levels, and their spending habits. This information can help you determine how much revenue you can expect to generate from your store.\n\nFinally, visit frequency analysis can help you understand how often people in your target area visit stores like yours. This information can help you develop marketing campaigns and promotions that encourage people to visit your store more often.\n\nLocation intelligence is also an important consideration when conducting an external analysis. You need to choose a location that is easily accessible to your target market and is in a high-traffic area. By using the latest location intelligence techniques, you can gain insight into key areas in which your target market is located.\n\nTravel time analysis can help you determine the active radius of your store, which is the distance that people are willing to travel to shop at your store. This information can help you choose a location that is easily accessible to your target market.\n\nCalculating the average spending amount can also help you estimate the expected revenue from your store. This information can help you determine whether your store is likely to be profitable in the long term.\n\nFinally, analysing customer flow can help you understand where your current and future customers are coming from. This information can help you make informed decisions about opening new stores and developing marketing campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, conducting an external analysis is an essential step in optimizing your store. By analysing the target area, competitors, target group, households, and possible visit frequency, you can gain a good understanding of the market and what you need to do to stand out. Location intelligence and customer flow analysis can also help you choose the best location for your store and develop effective marketing campaigns. By taking the time to conduct a thorough external analysis, you can position your store for long-term success.\n\n## 2. Analyse phase - Internal analyse\n\nWhen it comes to optimizing your online store, a thorough internal analysis is essential. It involves evaluating your business's current state and identifying areas for improvement. By doing so, you can create a roadmap that will help you achieve your goals and take your business to the next level.\n\nOne of the first things you should do during the internal analysis phase is to take a deep dive into your business's financials. This includes reviewing your revenue and expenses, identifying trends, and calculating your profit margins. Once you have a good understanding of your financials, you can start looking for areas where you can increase revenue and reduce costs.\n\nAnother important aspect of the internal analysis is evaluating your current product offerings. What products are selling well, and which ones are not? Are there any gaps in your product lineup that you need to fill? Are there any products that are underperforming that you should consider phasing out? These are all important questions to ask yourself during the internal analysis.\n\nIn addition to your product offerings, you should also evaluate your website's user experience. Is your website easy to navigate, and are your customers able to find what they're looking for quickly? Are there any technical issues that are impacting your website's performance? These are all important considerations that can impact your website's conversion rates and overall success.\n\nOnce you've completed your internal analysis, you'll have a much better understanding of your business's strengths and weaknesses. This information will be invaluable as you move on to the next phase of the optimization process: data analysis.\n\nDuring the data analysis phase, you'll use the insights gained during your internal analysis to identify opportunities for growth and develop a strategy for achieving your goals. This may involve things like targeting new geographic markets, expanding your product offerings, or improving your website's performance.\n\nAt every stage of the optimization process, it's important to keep your long-term vision in mind. While it's tempting to focus on short-term gains, it's crucial to make decisions that will set your business up for success in the long run. This is where our years of experience in data analysis can be incredibly valuable. We understand how to balance the need for short-term gains with the importance of long-term sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, the internal analysis phase is a critical part of optimizing your online store. By taking a deep dive into your business's financials, product offerings, and website user experience, you can identify areas for improvement and create a roadmap for achieving your goals. When combined with data analysis, this information will help you create an optimal store that is primed for success.\n\n## 3. Design phase, architecture of the building\n\nDuring phase two, we strive to achieve the perfect balance between form and function for your building. Our goal is to create a design that meets all of your wishes and needs. With years of experience working with global market leaders in the garden centre industry, we are able to design based not only on intuition but also on data. We have worked with numerous international clients who operate at the top level of garden centre retail, and as a result, we are capable of creating some of the best garden centres in the world.\n\nShape is an important aspect when it comes to achieving the desired look of a garden centre. Our team of experienced architects, who have worked in the industry for many years, will collaborate with you to prepare the basic look and feel of the building and liaise with local architects where necessary. Detailed discussions about the materials used in the design will take place at a later stage, as these have a significant impact on the appearance of a greenhouse building.\n\nA glasshouse building is an excellent place for visitors to shop and relax. Natural light has a positive influence on the health and well-being of people, which is why we strive for maximum transparency in our designs. However, given the high levels of UV radiation and the need to ensure plants receive the right amount of light, we work with high-quality products that can effectively block excess UV light.\n\nWe believe that every area requires a custom-made garden centre that is tailored to its unique needs. Whether you require an underground parking lot with several floors on top and an atrium, a simple greenhouse specializing in outdoor plants, or something entirely different, we have the expertise to help you make the right decision. Our focus is on connecting outdoor and indoor spaces, which is an area of expertise for us.\n\nThere is no such thing as a standard greenhouse anymore, with various designs and materials available to positively influence light transmission and durability. We can help you determine the best greenhouse solution for your specific needs, taking into consideration both short and long-term economic factors.\n\nWe have designed many garden centres over the years, and our knowledge of data and facts behind the success of these centres makes us a strong partner during the design and building phase. We understand the importance of fact-based building and can help optimize existing buildings with new materials, glasshouse constructions, signing, or by simply changing the current logistic flow. Trust us to help you design the best building for your budget.\n\n## 4. Optimize routing and instore supplies\n\nActually phase two, **design of the building** and phase three, **Routing and instore supplies** go hand in hand. A nice building with a bad routing give a bad result. A bad building with a nice routing can also give a negative result. We design and build the indoor and outdoor in perfect harmony.",

Besides that we look at the look and feel or the routing, ‘the flow’ and ‘feeling’. Every corner we want to surprise our customers. We want the customers to feel well and for this everything needs to be in good balance.\n\n**Soft variables that are very important for developing an optimal routing:**\n\nShape, smell, distance, communication about product, sounds and noises… Clockwise, counter clockwise, free flow or forced routing?\n\n*'All small ingredients that are so important for making a good and logical routing.'*\n\nQuestions like;\n\n- How do you present your products?\n- Do you use wood, steel, what colour, what materials do you use for what department?\n- Do you make use of shop in shop or do you only want to communicate your own brand?\n- What is the logical way regarding to your optimal customer journey?\n\nAll these questions we work on during the development of an optimal routing. After designing everything in our 3D program, we have the possibility to help you with the sourcing of your instore supplies. Optimal designing the interior of a store is a profession. The Greenconceptors will gladly assist you in making an optimal master plan for your store.\n\nBy listening to your wishes and needs and looking at an optimal plan together, it could be that you don’t even want to build a greenhouse, you may rather have a building with lots of glass or polycarbonate. We often have brainstorming sessions with our clients so that we end up with positive results. By having a good discussion, we sometimes get different views on aspects than we previously had.\n\nIt is crucial to determine the building parts we will focus on an put this in a 3D design, building and instore routing. This can be determined by knowing what the target market is that your garden centre will focus on. Will it be a plant centre, a decorative store or a place that the whole family will enjoy going to? These are all different questions that directly affect the design of the building.\n\nIt is important to us to utilise building materials that are readily available in the local area as much as possible. We will gladly help you to achieve this.",

The goal is to create an environment that promotes human well-being by reducing stress, increasing productivity, and enhancing creativity.\n\nBiophilic design is based on the idea that humans have an innate connection to nature. This connection has been developed over thousands of years, and it is believed that our well-being is linked to our relationship with the natural world. Biophilic design seeks to enhance this relationship by creating spaces that mimic the natural environment.",
